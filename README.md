# Pythonfirststeps
My first steps with Python

This is a basic repository for my first small programs while learning to code on Python.
These codes, as the material used for writing them, is free for use if they show some value for the user, so go ahead.

Please, if you feel there's something I can do better and feel like helping me out, my go over to my Telegram: https://t.me/jorgetorres, I'm always thrilled when receiving feedback and learning more.

These exercises, modified or not, are based on the ones shown on Dr. Chuck's course at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI
